Here the TODO list for the spikeinterface API

core:

    * add kachery extractor (jeremy)
    * save property as np (sam)
    * save features as np (sam)
    * event object (sam and alessio)
    * waveform extractors (sam)
    * segment concatenator (sam)
    * mono segment class (sam)

extractors:

    * nwb: reader/writer (with multi segment) (ben?)
    * all event reader (get_ttl()) (alessio)
    * MdaRecordingExtractor  : need to be done in neo ??
    * BiocamRecordingExtractor  : need to be done in neo
    * MaxOneRecordingExtractor  : need to be done in neo
    * MCSH5RecordingExtractor  : need to be done in neo ???
    * SHYBRIDRecordingExtractor:  need to be done in neo ???
    * NIXIORecordingExtractor: wrappe neo
    * CEDRecordingExtractor : need to be ported in neo
    * MdaSortingExtractor
    * HDSortSortingExtractor
    * HS2SortingExtractor
    * OpenEphysSortingExtractor : need to be done in neo
    * MaxOneSortingExtractor  : need to be done in neo
    * SHYBRIDSortingExtractor
    * NIXIOSortingExtractor
    * ALFSortingExtractor


toolkit:
  * curation: all - depend on waveform extractors
  * postprocessing: all - depend on waveform extractors
  * sorting components: all (sam)
  * validation : all - depend on waveform extractors

sorters:
  * almost done : needs tests
  * some sorter do not have yet the extractor

comparison:
  * done: need tests
  
widgets:
  * many widget to port with probeinterface in mind

examples:

  * check and read everything
  * toolkit examples

doc:

  * re make the API
  * read everything (typos/grammar)
  * try to build documentation with dithub actions as artifact after test (alessio ?)

tests suite:

  * make several workflow:
    *multi os for : core and extractors
    * unbuntu for all modules
  


Linled project:

  * herdingspikes: new API transpose and multi segment (cole)
  * mountainsort4: new API transpose and multi segment (jeremy)
  * spikeforest: new API transpose and multi segment (jeremy)
