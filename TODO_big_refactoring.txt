Here the TODO list for the NEW spikeinterface API

core:

    * add kachery extractor (jeremy)
    * save property as np (sam)
    * save features as np (sam)
    * event object (sam and alessio)
    * segment concatenator (sam)
    * mono segment class (sam)
    * add hither (alessio, sam or jeremy) for launcher and/or container
    * data retreiver based on datalad

extractors:

    * nwb: reader/writer (with multi segment) (ben?)
    * all event reader (get_ttl()) (alessio)
    * MdaRecordingExtractor  : need to be done in neo ??
    * BiocamRecordingExtractor  : need to be done in neo
    * MaxOneRecordingExtractor  : need to be done in neo
    * MCSH5RecordingExtractor  : need to be done in neo ???
    * SHYBRIDRecordingExtractor:  need to be done in neo ???
    * NIXIORecordingExtractor: wrappe neo
    * CEDRecordingExtractor : need to be ported in neo
    * MdaSortingExtractor
    * HDSortSortingExtractor
    * HS2SortingExtractor
    * OpenEphysSortingExtractor : need to be done in neo
    * MaxOneSortingExtractor  : need to be done in neo
    * SHYBRIDSortingExtractor
    * NIXIOSortingExtractor
    * ALFSortingExtractor

    * make tests with gin

toolkit:

  * curation:
    * ALL
  * postprocessing: 
     * export to phy
     * PCA
  * sorting components: all (sam)
  * validation aka qualitymetrics:
     * "max_drift",
     *  "cumulative_drift",
     * "silhouette_score",
     * "isolation_distance",
     * "l_ratio",
     * "d_prime", 
     * "noise_overlap",
     * "nn_hit_rate",
     * "nn_miss_rate",

sorters:

  * almost done : needs tests
  * is_installed() on run time
  * some sorter do not have yet the extractor
  * unify parameters for copy to binary > common methods
  * make something to not copy binary when not needed
  
comparison:
  * done: need tests


widgets:
  * many widget to port with probeinterface in mind


examples:

  * check and read everything
  * toolkit examples


doc:

  * re make the API
  * read everything (typos/grammar)
  * try to build documentation with dithub actions as artifact after test (alessio ?)


Tests suite:

  * make several workflow:
    * multi os for : core and extractors
    * unbuntu for all modules


Linked projects:

  * herdingspikes: new API transpose and multi segment (cole)
  * mountainsort4: new API transpose and multi segment (jeremy)
  * spikeforest: new API transpose and multi segment (jeremy)
  * tridesclous integrate recording extractor
