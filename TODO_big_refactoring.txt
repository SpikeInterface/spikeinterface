Here the TODO list for the NEW spikeinterface API

core:
    * add kachery extractor (jeremy)
    * save features as np (sam)
    * waveform_extractor improve cache option
    * time vector
    * binary_interface()


extractors:

    * nwb: reader/writer (with multi segment) (ben?)
    * BiocamRecordingExtractor  : need to be done in neo
    * CEDRecordingExtractor : need merge from neo
    * OpenEphysSortingExtractor : need to be done in neo
    * MaxOneSortingExtractor  : need to be done in neo

toolkit:
  * preprocessing:
    * ResampleRecording

  * validation (= qualitymetrics):
     * decide good channel selection in PCA metrics
     * "max_drift",
     * "cumulative_drift",
     * "silhouette_score",
     * "noise_overlap",

  * get_random_data_for_scaling(recording, num_chunks_per_segment=20, chunk_size=10000, seed=0)
     remove chunk and use duration instead.




sorters:

  * almost done : needs tests
  * is_installed() on run time
  * unify parameters for copy to binary > common methods
  * make something to not copy binary when not needed
  
  * install all files *.m, *.prm


widgets:
  * fix plot_multicomp_graph()


examples:

  * check and read everything
  * toolkit examples
  * make more example with widgets
  


doc:

  * read everything (typos/grammar)
  * try to build documentation with dithub actions as artifact after test (alessio ?)




Linked projects:

  * herdingspikes: new API transpose and multi segment (cole)
  * mountainsort4: new API transpose and multi segment (jeremy)
  * spikeforest: new API transpose and multi segment (jeremy)
  * tridesclous integrate recording extractor
