        "\n# Handle probe drift with spikeinterface NEW\n\nProbe movement is an inevitability when running\n*in vivo* electrophysiology recordings. Motion, caused by physical\nmovement of the probe or the sliding of brain tissue\ndeforming across the probe, can complicate the sorting\nand analysis of units.\n\nSpikeinterface offers a flexible framework to handle motion correction\nas a preprocessing step. In this tutorial we will cover the three main\ndrift-correction algorithms implemented in SpikeInterface\n(**rigid_fast**, **kilosort_like** and **nonrigid_accurate**) with\na focus on running the methods and interpreting the output.\n\nFor more information on the theory and implementation of these methods,\nsee the `motion_correction` section of the documentation.\n\n## What is probe drift?\n\nThe inserted probe can move from side-to-side (*'x' direction*),\nup-or-down (*'y' direction*) or forwards-or-backwards (*'z' direction*).\nMovement in the 'x' and 'y' direction is harder to model than vertical\ndrift (i.e. along the probe depth), and are not handled by most motion\ncorrection algorithms. Fortunately, vertical drift which is most easily \nhandled is most pronounced as the probe is most likely to move along the path of insertion. \n\nVertical drift can come in two forms, *'rigid'* and *'non-rigid'*. Rigid drift\nis drift caused by movement of the entire probe, and the motion is\nsimilar across all channels along the probe depth. In contrast,\nnon-rigid drift is instead caused by local movements brain along the\nprobe, and can selectively affect subsets of channels..\n\n## The drift correction steps\n\nThe easiest way to run drift correction in SpikeInterface is with the\nhigh-level :py:func:`~spikeinterface.preprocessing.correct_motion()` function.\nThis function takes a preprocessed recording as input and returns a motion-corrected\nrecording object. As with all other preprocessing steps, the correction (in this\ncase interpolation of the data to correct the detected motion) is lazy and applied on-the-fly when data is needed).\n\nThe :py:func:`~spikeinterface.preprocessing.correct_motion()`\nfunction implements motion correction algorithms in a modular way\nwrapping a number of subfunctions that together implement the \nfull drift correction algorithm.\n\nThese drift-correction modules are:\n\n| **1.** ``localize_peaks()`` (detect spikes and localize their position on the probe)\n| **2.** ``select_peaks()`` (optional, select a subset of peaks to use to estimate motion)\n| **3.** ``estimate_motion()`` (estimate motion using the detected spikes)\n| **4.** ``interpolate_motion()`` (perform interpolation on the raw data to account for the estimated drift).\n\nAll these sub-steps have many parameters which dictate the\nspeed and effectiveness of motion correction. As such, ``correct_motion``\nprovides three setting 'presets' which configure the motion correct\nto proceed either as:\n\n* **rigid_fast** - a fast, not particularly accurate correction assuming ridigt drift.\n* **kilosort-like** - Mimics what is done in Kilosort.\n* **nonrigid_accurate** - A decentralised drift correction (DREDGE), introduced by the Paninski group.\n\nWhen using motion correction in your analysis, please make sure to\n`cite the appropriate paper for your chosen method<cite-motion-correction>`.\n\n\n**Now, let's dive into running motion correction with these three\nmethods on a simulated dataset.**\n"
