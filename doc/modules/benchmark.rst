Benchmark module
================

This module contains machinery to compare some sorters against ground truth in many multiple situtation.


..notes::

    In 0.102.0 The previous :py:func:`~spikeinterface.comparison.GroundTruthStudy()` has been replaced by
    :py:func:`~spikeinterface.benchmark.SorterStudy()`


This module also aims to benchmark sorting components (detection, clustering, motion, template matching) using the
same base class :py:func:`~spikeinterface.benchmark.BenchmarkStudy()` but specialized to a targeted component.

By design, the main class handle the concept of "levels" : this allows to compare several complexities at the same time.
For instance, compare kilosort4 vs kilsort2.5 (level 0) for different noises amplitudes (level 1) combined with
several motion vectors (leevel 2).

**Example: compare many sorters : a ground truth study**

We have a high level class to compare many sorters against ground truth: :py:func:`~spikeinterface.benchmark.SorterStudy()`


A study is a systematic performance comparison of several ground truth recordings with several sorters or several cases
like the different parameter sets.

The study class proposes high-level tool functions to run many ground truth comparisons with many "cases"
on many recordings and then collect and aggregate results in an easy way.

The all mechanism is based on an intrinsic organization into a "study_folder" with several subfolders:

  * datasets: contains ground truth datasets
  * sorters : contains outputs of sorters
  * sortings: contains light copy of all sorting
  * metrics: contains metrics
  * ...

    # As shown previously, the performance is returned as a pandas dataframe.
    # The spikeinterface.comparison.get_performance_by_unit() function,
    # gathers all the outputs in the study folder and merges them into a single dataframe.
    # Same idea for spikeinterface.comparison.get_count_units()

Benchmark spike collisions
--------------------------

SpikeInterface also has a specific toolset to benchmark how well sorters are at recovering spikes in "collision".

We have three classes to handle collision-specific comparisons, and also to quantify the effects on correlogram
estimation:

  * :py:class:`~spikeinterface.comparison.CollisionGTComparison`
  * :py:class:`~spikeinterface.comparison.CorrelogramGTComparison`
