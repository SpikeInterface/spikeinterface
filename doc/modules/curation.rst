Curation module
===============

**Note:** As of February 2023, this module is still under construction and quite experimental.
The API of some of the functions could be changed/improved from time to time.

Manual curation
---------------

SpikeInterface offers machinery to manually curate a sorting output and keep track of the curation history.
The curation has several "steps" that can be repeated and chained:

  * remove/select units
  * split units
  * merge units

This functionality is done with :py:class:`~spikeinterface.curation.CurationSorting` class.
Internally, this class keeps the history of curation as a graph.
The merging and splitting operations are handled by the :py:class:`~spikeinterface.curation.MergeUnitsSorting` and
:py:class:`~spikeinterface.curation.SplitUnitSorting`. These two classes can also be used independently.


.. code-block:: python

    from spikeinterface.curation import CurationSorting

    sorting = run_sorter(sorter_name='kilosort2', recording=recording)

    cs = CurationSorting(parent_sorting=sorting)

    # make a first merge
    cs.merge(units_to_merge=['#1', '#5', '#15'])

    # make a second merge
    cs.merge(units_to_merge=['#11', '#21'])

    # make a split
    split_index = ... # some criteria on spikes
    cs.split(split_unit_id='#20', indices_list=split_index)

    # here is the final clean sorting
    clean_sorting = cs.sorting


Automatic curation tools
------------------------

`Lussac <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.08.479192v1>`_ is an external package with several strategies
for automatic curation of a spike sorting output.

Some of them, like the auto-merging, have been ported to SpikeInterface.
The :py:func:`~spikeinterface.curation.get_potential_auto_merge` function returns a list of potential merges.
The list of potential merges can be then applied to the sorting output.
:py:func:`~spikeinterface.curation.get_potential_auto_merge` has many internal tricks and steps to identify potential
merges. Therefore, it has many parameters and options.
**Read the function documentation carefully and do not apply it blindly!**


.. code-block:: python

    from spikeinterface.curation import MergeUnitsSorting, get_potential_auto_merge

    sorting = run_sorter(sorter_name='kilosort', recording=recording)

    we = extract_waveforms(recording=recording, sorting=sorting, folder='wf_folder')

    # merges is a list of lists, with unit_ids to be merged.
    merges = get_potential_auto_merge(waveform_extractor=we, minimum_spikes=1000,  maximum_distance_um=150.,
                                      peak_sign="neg", bin_ms=0.25, window_ms=100.,
                                      corr_diff_thresh=0.16, template_diff_thresh=0.25,
                                      censored_period_ms=0., refractory_period_ms=1.0,
                                      contamination_threshold=0.2, num_channels=5, num_shift=5,
                                      firing_contamination_balance=1.5)

    # here we apply the merges
    clean_sorting = MergeUnitsSorting(parent_sorting=sorting, units_to_merge=merges)


Manual curation with sortingview
---------------------------------

Within the :code:`sortingview` widgets backend (see :ref:`sorting_view`), the
:py:func:`~spikeinterface.widgets.plot_sorting_summary` produces a powerful web-based GUI that enables manual curation
of the spike sorting output.

.. image:: ../images/sv_summary.png

The manual curation (including merges and labels) can be applied to a SpikeInterface
:py:class:`~spikeinterface.core.BaseSorting` object:


.. code-block:: python


    from spikeinterface.curation import apply_sortingview_curation
    from spikeinterface.postprocessing import (compute_spike_amplitudes, compute_unit_locations,
                                               compute_template_similarity, compute_correlograms)
    from spikeinterface.widgets import plot_sorting_summary

    # run a sorter and export waveforms
    sorting = run_sorter(sorter_name'kilosort2', recording=recording)
    we = extract_waveforms(recording=recording, sorting=sorting, folder='wf_folder')

    # some postprocessing is required
    _ = compute_spike_amplitudes(waveform_extractor=we)
    _ = compute_unit_locations(waveform_extractor=we)
    _ = compute_template_similarity(waveform_extractor=we)
    _ = compute_correlograms(waveform_extractor=we)

    # This loads the data to the cloud for web-based plotting and sharing
    # curation=True required for allowing curation in the sortingview gui
    plot_sorting_summary(waveform_extractor=we, curation=True, backend='sortingview')
    # we open the printed link URL in a browser
    # - make manual merges and labeling
    # - from the curation box, click on "Save as snapshot (sha1://)"

    # copy the uri
    sha_uri = "sha1://59feb326204cf61356f1a2eb31f04d8e0177c4f1"
    clean_sorting = apply_sortingview_curation(sorting=sorting, uri_or_json=sha_uri)

Note that you can also "Export as JSON" and pass the json file as :code:`uri_or_json` parameter.

The curation JSON file can be also pushed to a user-defined GitHub repository ("Save to GitHub as...")


Other curation tools
--------------------

We have other tools for cleaning spike sorting outputs:

 * :py:func:`~spikeinterface.curation.find_duplicated_spikes` : find duplicated spikes in the spike trains
 * | :py:func:`~spikeinterface.curation.remove_duplicated_spikes` : remove all duplicated spikes from the spike trains
   | :py:class:`~spikeinterface.core.BaseSorting` object (internally using the previous function)
 * | :py:func:`~spikeinterface.curation.remove_excess_spikes` : remove spikes whose times are greater than the
   | recording's number of samples (by segment)
