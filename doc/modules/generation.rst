Generation module
=================

The :py:mod:`spikeinterface.generation` provides functions to generate recordings containing spikes.
This module proposes several approaches for this including purely synthetic recordings as well as "hybrid" recordings (where templates come from true datasets).


The :py:mod:`spikeinterface.core.generate` already provides functions for generating synthetic data but this module will supply an extended and more complex
machinery, for instance generating recordings that possess various types of drift.
