Metrics module
==============


The :py:mod:`~spikeinterface.metrics` module includes functions to compute various metrics related to spike sorting.

Currently, it contains the following submodules:

- **template metrics**: Computes commonly used waveform/template metrics.
- **quality metrics**: Computes a variety of quality metrics to assess the goodness of spike sorting outputs.
- **spiketrain metrics**: Computes metrics based on spike train statistics and correlogram shapes.
