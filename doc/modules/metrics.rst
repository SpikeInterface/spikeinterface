Metrics
-------

The :py:mod:`~spikeinterface.metrics` module includes functions to compute various metrics related to spike sorting.

Currently, it contains the following submodules:

- :ref:`template_metrics <modules/metrics/template_metrics>`: Computes commonly used waveform/template metrics.
- :ref:`quality_metrics <modules/metrics/quality_metrics>`: Computes a variety of quality metrics to assess the goodness of spike sorting outputs.
- :ref:`spiketrain_metrics <modules/metrics/spiketrain_metrics>`: Computes metrics based on spike train statistics and correlogram shapes.
