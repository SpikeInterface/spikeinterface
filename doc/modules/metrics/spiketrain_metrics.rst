Spike Train Metrics
===================

The :py:mod:`~spikeinterface.metrics.spiketrain_metrics` module includes functions to compute metrics based on spike train statistics and correlogram shapes.
Currently, the following metrics are implemented:

- "num_spikes": number of spikes in the spike train.
- "firing_rate": firing rate of the spike train (spikes per second).

# TODO: Add more metrics such as ISI distribution, CV, etc.
