Postprocessing module
=====================

.. _extensions:

After spike sorting, we can use the :py:mod:`~spikeinterface.postprocessing` module to further post-process
the spike sorting output. Most of the post-processing functions require a
:py:class:`~spikeinterface.core.WaveformExtractor` as input.

.. _waveform_extensions:

WaveformExtractor extensions
----------------------------

There are several postprocessing tools available, and all 
of them are implemented as a :py:class:`~spikeinterface.core.BaseWaveformExtractorExtension`. All computations on top
of a WaveformExtractor will be saved along side the WaveformExtractor itself (sub  folder, zarr path or sub dict).
This workflow is convenient to retrieve time-consuming computation (such as pca or spike amplitudes) when reloading  
WaveformExtractor.

:py:class:`~spikeinterface.core.BaseWaveformExtractorExtension`  objects are tightly connected to the
parent :code:`WaveformExtractor` object, so that operations done on the :code:`WaveformExtractor`, such as saving,
loading, or selecting units, will be automatically applied to all extensions.

To check what extensions are available for a :code:`WaveformExtractor` named :code:`we`, you can use:

.. code-block:: python

    import spikeinterface as si

    available_extension_names = we.get_available_extension_names()
    print(available_extension_names)

.. code-block:: bash

    ["principal_components", "spike_amplitudes"]

In this case, for example, principal components and spike amplitudes have been already computed.
To load the extension object you can run:

.. code-block:: python

    ext = we.load_extension("spike_amplitudes")
    ext_data = ext.get_data()

Here :code:`ext` is the extension object (in this case the :code:`SpikeAmplitudeCalculator`), and :code:`ext_data` will 
contain the actual amplitude data. Note that different extensions might have different ways to return the extension.
You can use :code:`ext.get_data?` for documentation.


We can also delete an extension:

.. code-block:: python

    we.delete_extension("spike_amplitudes")



Available postptocessing extensions
-----------------------------------

noise_levels
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This extension computes the noise level of each channel using the median absolute deviation.
As an extension, this expects the :code:`WaveformExtractor` as input and the computed values are persistent on disk.

The :py:func:`~spikeinterface.core.get_noise_levels(recording)` computes the same values, but starting from a recording 
and without saving the data as an extension.


For more information, see :py:func:`~spikeinterface.postprocessing.compute_noise_levels`



principal_components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This extension computes the principal components of the waveforms. There are several modes available:

* "by_channel_local" (default): fits one PCA model for each by_channel
* "by_channel_global": fits the same PCA model to all channels (also termed temporal PCA)
* "concatenated": contatenates all channels and fits a PCA model on the concatenated data

If the input :code:`WaveformExtractor` is sparse, the sparsity is used when computing PCA.
For dense waveforms, sparsity can also be passed as an argument.

For more information, see :py:func:`~spikeinterface.postprocessing.compute_principal_components`

template_similarity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


This extension computes the similarity of the templates to each other. This information could be used for automatic 
merging. Currently, the only available similarity method is the cosine similarity, which is the angle between the 
high-dimensional flattened template arrays. Note that cosine similarity does not take into account amplitude differences 
and is not well suited for high-density probes.


For more information, see :py:func:`~spikeinterface.postprocessing.compute_template_similarity`



spike_amplitudes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This extension computes the amplitude of each spike as the value of the traces on the extremum channel at the times of 
each spike.

**NOTE:** computing spike amplitudes is highly recommended before calculating amplitude-based quality metrics, such as 
:ref:`amp_cutoff` and :ref:`amp_median`.

For more information, see :py:func:`~spikeinterface.postprocessing.compute_spike_amplitudes`


spike_locations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


This extension estimates the location of each spike in the sorting output. Spike location estimates can be done either 
with center of mass (:code:`method="center_of_mass"` - fast, but less accurate), or using a monopolar triangulation 
(:code:`method="monopolar_triangulation"` - slow, but more accurate). 

**NOTE:** computing spike locations is required to compute :ref:`drift_metrics`.


For more information, see :py:func:`~spikeinterface.postprocessing.compute_spike_locations`


unit locations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


This extension is similar to the :code:`spike_locations`, but instead to estimate a location for each spike it computes 
at the unit level, using the templates instead of individual waveforms. The same localization methods 
(:code:`method="center_of_mass" | "monopolar_triangulation"`) are available.

For more information, see :py:func:`~spikeinterface.postprocessing.compute_unit_locations`


template_metrics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This extension computes commonly used waveform/template metrics. 
By default, the following metrics are computed:

* "peak_to_valley": duration between negative and positive peaks
* "halfwidth": duration in s at 50% of the amplitude
* "peak_to_trough_ratio": ratio between negative and positive peaks
* "recovery_slope": speed in V/s to recover from the negative peak to 0
* "repolarization_slope": speed in V/s to repolarize from the positive peak to 0

For more information, see :py:func:`~spikeinterface.postprocessing.compute_template_metrics`


correlograms
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This extension computes correlograms (both auto- and cross-) for spike trains. The computed output is a 3d array 
with shape (num_units, num_units, num_bins) with all correlograms for each pair of units (diagonals are auto-correlograms).

For more information, see :py:func:`~spikeinterface.postprocessing.compute_correlograms`


isi_histograms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This extension computes the histograms of inter-spike-intervals. The computed output is a 2d array with shape 
(num_units, num_bins), with the isi histogram of each unit.

For more information, see :py:func:`~spikeinterface.postprocessing.compute_isi_histograms`


Other postprocessing tools
--------------------------

align_sorting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This function aligns the spike trains a :code:`BaseSorting` object using pre-computed shifts of misaligned templates.
To compute shifts, one can use the :py:func:`~spikeinterface.core.get_template_extremum_channel_peak_shift` function.

For more information, see :py:func:`~spikeinterface.postprocessing.align_sorting`
