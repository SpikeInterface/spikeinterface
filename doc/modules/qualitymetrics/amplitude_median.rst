.. _amp_median:

Amplitude median (:code:`amplitude_median`)
===========================================

Calculation
-----------

Geometric median amplitude is computed in the log domain.
The metric is then converted back to original units.

Expectation and use
-------------------

A larger value (larger signal) indicates a better unit.


Example code
------------

.. code-block:: python

	import spikeinterface.qualitymetrics as qm

	# It is also recommended to run `compute_spike_amplitudes(wvf_extractor)`
	# in order to use amplitude values from all spikes.
	amplitude_medians = qm.compute_amplitude_medians(wvf_extractor)
	# amplitude_medians is a dict containing the units' IDs as keys,
	# and their estimated amplitude medians as values.
