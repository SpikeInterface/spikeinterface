Noise cutoff (not currently implemented)
========================================

Calculation
-----------


Metric describing whether an amplitude distribution is cut off, similar to _amp_cutoff  :ref:`amplitude cutoff <amp_cutoff>` but without a Gaussian assumption.
A histogram of amplitudes is created and quantifies the distance between the low tail, mean number of spikes and high tail in terms of standard deviations.

A SpikeInterface implementation is not yet available.

Expectation and use
-------------------

Noise cutoff attempts to describe whether an amplitude distribution is cut off.
The metric is loosely based on [Hill]_'s amplitude cutoff, but is here adapted (originally by [IBL]_) to avoid making the Gaussianity assumption on spike distributions.
Noise cutoff provides an estimate of false negative rate, so a lower value indicates fewer missed spikes (a more complete unit).
