Signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio
===========================

Calculation
-----------

- :math:`A_{\mu s}` : maximum amplitude of the mean spike waverform (possibly???).
- :math:`\sigma_b` : standard deviation of the background noise on one channel (noise).

.. math::
    \textrm{SNR} = \frac{A_{\mu s}}{\sigma_b}



Expectation and use
-------------------

A high SNR unit has a signal which is greater in amplitude than the background noise and is likely to correspond to a neuron [Jackson]_, [Lemon]_.
A low SNR value (close to 0) suggests that the unit is highly contaminated by noise (type I error).
