SpikeInterface 0.96.1 release notes
-----------------------------------

27th October 2022


Main change:
 * Bump up probeinterface version to version 0.2.14 due to bug fix in reading SpikeGLX electrode locations
   https://probeinterface.readthedocs.io/en/main/releases/0.2.14.html

.. warning::
    Probeinterface v0.2.14 fixes a **important bug** in :code:`read_spikeglx()` / :code:`read_imro()` that was
    leading to wrong contact locations when the Imec Readout Table (aka imRo) was set with complex multi-bank patterns.
    The bug was introduced with version **0.2.10**, released on September 1st 2022, and it is also present in these
    versions: **0.2.10**, **0.2.11**, **0.2.12**, and **0.2.13**.
    **If you used spikeinterface/probeinterface with SpikeGLX data using one of these versions, we recommend you
    to check your contact positions (if they are non-standard - using the probe tip) and re-run your spike-sorting
    analysis if they are wrong.**


Other changes/bug fix:
  * Remove waveform_extractor.recording form template_tools (#1031)
  * Fix nbefore parsing in InjectTemplatesRecording (#1032)
  * Use parent recording dtype for InjectTemplates (#1033)
