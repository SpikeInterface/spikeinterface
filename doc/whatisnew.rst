===============

* Minor release with some bug fixes and Kilosort4 support


Version 0.100.0
===============

* Several improvements and bug fixes for Windows users
* Important refactoring of NWB extractors:
  * implemented direct backend implementation (to avoid using `pynwb`)
  * sped up streaming using `remfile`
  * added support for `zarr` backend
* Removed `joblib` dependency in favor of `ParallelProcessExecutor`
* Improved flexibility when running sorters in containers by adding several options for installing `spikeinterface`
* Add `Templates` class to core, which handles unit templates and sparsity (#1982)
* Added Zarr-backend to `Sorting` objects (`sorting.save(folder="...", format="zarr")`) (#2403)
* Added `SharedmemRecording` for shared memory recordings (#2365)
* Added machinery for moving/interpolating templates for generating hybrid recordings with drift (#2291)
* Added new fast method for unit/spike/peak localization: `grid_convolution` (#2172)


Version 0.99.1
==============

* Minor release with some bug fixes


Version 0.99.0
==============

* Refactored :code:`core.generate` module to create high-quality lazy ground-truth data
* Added DeepInterpolation training, transfer, and inference to preprocessing
* Added new quality_metrics (synchrony, firing_range, amplitude_cv)
* Added new template metrics (num positive/negative peaks + multi-channel metrics: velocities, spread, exp. decay)
* Important improvements to internal sorters (especially Spyking Circus 2)
* Ported all widgets to "new" API and dismantled legacy widgets
* Extensive clean-up of docstrings, code style, and documentation


Version 0.98.2
==============

* Minor release with some bug fixes


Version 0.98.1
==============

* Minor release with some bug fixes


Version 0.98.0
==============

* Implemented motion correction framework in SpikeInterface
* Added "grid convolution" as localization method
* Added amplitude_scaling implementation in postprocessing
* Improved container support for docker and singularity
* Improved implementation and performance of quality metrics module
* Extensive additions to :code:`sortingcomponents`` module (pipeline nodes, waveform denoising, sparsity)
* :code:`_ind` to :code:`_index` in complex dtype representation for peak and spikes

Version 0.97.1
==============

* Minor release with some bug fixes and minor new features


Version 0.97.0
==============

* Implemented "sparse" waveforms in core and propagated to all modules:

  * Add waveform extractor :code:`save()` function and Zarr backend
  * Dense waveforms can be saved as sparse with the :code:`save()` function
  * Sparse waveforms can be extracted directly with :code:`sparse=True`
* Added IBL preprocessing tools for Neuropixels:

  * Bad channel detection
  * Channel interpolation
  * High-pass spatial filter
* | Add subfolder for sorter output ("output_folder/sorter_output") and :code:`sorting_info` field to Sorting,
  | so that "sorter_output" can be deleted without deleting metadata and :code:`sorting_info`
* Refactor Quality Metrics module:

  * Improve parameter handling
  * Unified naming and conventions
  * Add missing metrics: drift, amp medians, sliding_rp_violations
* Extended Motion estimation and motion correction, which is now ready to use
* Removed deprecated functions/modules:

  * :code:`toolkit` module
  * :code:`symmetrize` argument from compute_correlograms
  * :code:`localize_units` from postprocessing

* Major rewrite of the docs, with extensive module-specific documentation
