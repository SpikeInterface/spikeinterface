For "How to"
============

These python scripts are files which we would like sphinx-gallery to run,
but are linked by the how to guide.

All the python files in this folder are built by sphinx-gallery. The resulting
documentation page can be added to the "How to" section of the documentation by modifying
the file ``doc/how_to/index.rst``.
