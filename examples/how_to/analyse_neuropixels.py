#
# The `SpikeGLX` folder can contain several "streams" (AP, LF and NIDQ).
# We need to specify which one to read:

# ## Preprocess the recording
#
# Let's do something similar to the IBL destriping chain (See :ref:`ibl_destripe`) to preprocess the data but:
#
#  * instead of interpolating bad channels, we remove then.
#  * instead of highpass_spatial_filter() we use common_reference()

# ### Should we save the preprocessed data to a binary file?
#
# Depending on the machine, the I/O speed, and the number of times we will need to "use" the preprocessed recording, we can decide whether it is convenient to save the preprocessed recording to a file.
#
# Saving is not necessarily a good choice, as it consumes a lot of disk space and sometimes the writing to disk can be slower than recomputing the preprocessing chain on-the-fly.
#
# Here, we decide to do save it because Kilosort requires a binary file as input, so the preprocessed recording will need to be saved at some point.
#
# Depending on the complexity of the preprocessing chain, this operation can take a while. However, we can make use of the powerful parallelization mechanism of SpikeInterface.

# ## Check spiking activity and drift before spike sorting
#
# A good practice before running a spike sorter is to check the "peaks activity" and the presence of drifts.
#
# SpikeInterface has several tools to:
#
#   * estimate the noise levels
#   * detect peaks (prior to sorting)
#   * estimate positions of peaks
#

# ### Check noise level
#
# Noise levels can be estimated on the scaled traces or on the raw (`int16`) traces.
#

# we can estimate the noise on the scaled traces (microV) or on the raw one (which is in our case int16).
noise_levels_microV = si.get_noise_levels(rec, return_scaled=True)
noise_levels_int16 = si.get_noise_levels(rec, return_scaled=False)


fig, ax = plt.subplots()
_ = ax.hist(noise_levels_microV, bins=np.arange(5, 30, 2.5))
ax.set_xlabel('noise  [microV]')

# ### Detect and localize peaks
#
# SpikeInterface includes built-in algorithms to detect peaks and also to localize their position.
#
# This is part of the **sortingcomponents** module and needs to be imported explicitly.
#
# The two functions (detect + localize):
#
#   * can be run parallel 
#   * are very fast when the preprocessed recording is already saved (and a bit slower otherwise)
#   * implement several methods
#
# Let's use here the `locally_exclusive` method for detection and the `center_of_mass` for peak localization:

# +
from spikeinterface.sortingcomponents.peak_detection import detect_peaks

job_kwargs = dict(n_jobs=40, chunk_duration='1s', progress_bar=True)
peaks = detect_peaks(rec,  method='locally_exclusive', noise_levels=noise_levels_int16, 
                     detect_threshold=5, local_radius_um=50., **job_kwargs)
peaks

# +
from spikeinterface.sortingcomponents.peak_localization import localize_peaks

peak_locations = localize_peaks(rec, peaks, method='center_of_mass', local_radius_um=50., **job_kwargs)
# -

# ### Check for drifts
#
# We can *manually* check for drifts with a simple scatter plots of peak times VS estimated peak depths.
#
# In this example, we do not see any apparent drift.
#
# In case we notice apparent drifts in the recording, one can use the SpikeInterface modules to estimate and correct motion. See the documentation for motion estimation and correction for more details.

# check for drifts
fs = rec.sampling_frequency
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 8))
ax.scatter(peaks['sample_ind'] / fs, peak_locations['y'], color='k', marker='.',  alpha=0.002)


# +
# we can also use the peak location estimates to have an insight of cluster separation before sorting
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(15, 10))
si.plot_probe_map(rec, ax=ax, with_channel_ids=True)
ax.set_ylim(-100, 150)

ax.scatter(peak_locations['x'], peak_locations['y'], color='purple', alpha=0.002)

# ## Run a spike sorter
#
# Even if running spike sorting is probably the most critical part of the pipeline, in SpikeInterface this is dead-simple: one function.
#
# **Important notes**:
#
#   * most of sorters are wrapped from external tools (kilosort, kisolort2.5, spykingcircus, montainsort4 ...) that often also need other requirements (e.g., MATLAB, CUDA)
#   * some sorters are internally developed (spyekingcircus2)
#   * external sorter can be run inside a container (docker, singularity) WITHOUT pre-installation
#
# Please carwfully read the `spikeinterface.sorters` documentation for more information.
#
# In this example: 
#
#   * we will run kilosort2.5
#   * we apply no drift correction (because we don't have drift)
#   * we use the docker image because we don't want to pay for MATLAB :)
#

# check default params for kilosort2.5
si.get_default_sorter_params('kilosort2_5')

# +
# run kilosort2.5 without drift correction
params_kilosort2_5 = {'do_correction': False}

sorting = si.run_sorter('kilosort2_5', rec, output_folder=base_folder / 'kilosort2.5_output',
                        docker_image=True, verbose=True, **params_kilosort2_5)
# -

# the results can be read back for futur session
sorting = si.read_sorter_folder(base_folder / 'kilosort2.5_output')

# here we have 31 untis in our recording
sorting

# ## Post processing
#
# All the postprocessing step is based on the **WaveformExtractor** object.
#
# This object combines a `recording` and a `sorting` object and extracts some waveform snippets (500 by default) for each units.
#
# Note that we use the `sparse=True` option. This option is important because the waveforms will be extracted only for a few channels around the main channel of each unit. This saves tons of disk space and speeds up the waveforms extraction and further processing.
#

we = si.extract_waveforms(rec, sorting, folder=base_folder / 'waveforms_kilosort2.5',
                          sparse=True, max_spikes_per_unit=500, ms_before=1.5,ms_after=2.,
                          **job_kwargs)

# the WaveformExtractor contains all information and is persistent on disk 
print(we)
print(we.folder)

# the waveform extractor can be easily loaded back from folder
we = si.load_waveforms(base_folder / 'waveforms_kilosort2.5')
we

# Many additional computations rely on the `WaveformExtractor`.
# Some computations are slower than others, but can be performed in parallel using the `**job_kwargs` mechanism.
#
# Every computation will also be persistent on disk in the same folder, since they represent waveform extensions.

_ = si.compute_noise_levels(we)
_ = si.compute_correlograms(we)
_ = si.compute_unit_locations(we)
_ = si.compute_spike_amplitudes(we, **job_kwargs)
_ = si.compute_template_similarity(we)


# ## Quality metrics
#
# We have a single function `compute_quality_metrics(WaveformExtractor)` that returns a `pandas.Dataframe` with the desired metrics.
#
# Please visit the [metrics documentation](https://spikeinterface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/qualitymetrics.html) for more information and a list of all supported metrics.
#
# Some metrics are based on PCA (like `'isolation_distance', 'l_ratio', 'd_prime'`) and require to estimate PCA for their computation. This can be achieved with:
#
# `si.compute_principal_components(waveform_extractor)`

metrics = si.compute_quality_metrics(we, metric_names=['firing_rate', 'presence_ratio', 'snr',
                                                       'isi_violation', 'amplitude_cutoff'])
metrics

# ## Curation using metrics
#
# A very common curation approach is to threshold these metrics to select *good* units:

# +
amplitude_cutoff_thresh = 0.1
isi_violations_ratio_thresh = 1
presence_ratio_thresh = 0.9

our_query = f"(amplitude_cutoff < {amplitude_cutoff_thresh}) & (isi_violations_ratio < {isi_violations_ratio_thresh}) & (presence_ratio > {presence_ratio_thresh})"
print(our_query)
# -

keep_units = metrics.query(our_query)
keep_unit_ids = keep_units.index.values
keep_unit_ids

# ## Export final results to disk folder and visulize with sortingview
#
# In order to export the final results we need to make a copy of the the waveforms, but only for the selected units (so we can avoid to compute them again).

we_clean = we.select_units(keep_unit_ids, new_folder=base_folder / 'waveforms_clean')

we_clean

# Then we export figures to a report folder

# export spike sorting report to a folder
si.export_report(we_clean, base_folder / 'report', format='png')

we_clean = si.load_waveforms(base_folder / 'waveforms_clean')
we_clean

# And push the results to sortingview webased viewer
#
# ```python
# si.plot_sorting_summary(we_clean, backend='sortingview')
# ```
