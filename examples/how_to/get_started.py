How to "get started"
====================

In this introductory example, you will see how to use SpikeInterface to perform a full electrophysiology analysis.
We will download a simulated dataset, and we will then perform some pre-processing, run a spike sorting
algorithm, post-process the spike sorting output, perform curation (manual and automatic), and compare spike sorting results.

"""

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from pprint import pprint

# The spikeinterface module by itself imports only the spikeinterface.core submodule
# which is not useful for the end user

import spikeinterface

# We need to import one by one different submodules separately (preferred).
# There are several modules:
#
# - `extractors` : file IO
# - `preprocessing` : preprocessing
# - `sorters` : Python wrappers of spike sorters
# - `postprocessing` : postprocessing
# - `qualitymetrics` : quality metrics on units found by sorters
# - `curation` : automatic curation of spike sorting output
# - `comparison` : comparison of spike sorting outputs
# - `widgets` : visualization

import spikeinterface as si  # import core only
import spikeinterface.extractors as se
import spikeinterface.preprocessing as spre
import spikeinterface.sorters as ss
import spikeinterface.postprocessing as spost
import spikeinterface.qualitymetrics as sqm
import spikeinterface.comparison as sc
import spikeinterface.exporters as sexp
import spikeinterface.curation as scur
import spikeinterface.widgets as sw

# Alternatively, we can import all submodules at once with `import spikeinterface.full as si` which
# internally imports core+extractors+preprocessing+sorters+postprocessing+
# qualitymetrics+comparison+widgets+exporters. In this case all aliases in the following tutorial
# would be `si`.

# This is useful for notebooks, but it is a heavier import because internally many more dependencies
# are imported (scipy/sklearn/networkx/matplotlib/h5py...)

import spikeinterface.full as si

# Before getting started, we can set some global arguments for parallel processing. For this example, let's use 4 jobs and time chunks of 1s:

global_job_kwargs = dict(n_jobs=4, chunk_duration="1s")
si.set_global_job_kwargs(**global_job_kwargs)

# First, let's download a simulated dataset from the
# https://gin.g-node.org/NeuralEnsemble/ephy_testing_data repo
# We download the dataset using DataLad but it can also be downloaded directly.

# Then we can open it. Note that [MEArec](https://mearec.readthedocs.io>) simulated files
# contain both a "recording" and a "sorting" object.

local_path = si.download_dataset(remote_path="mearec/mearec_test_10s.h5")
recording, sorting_true = se.read_mearec(local_path)
print(recording)
print(sorting_true)

# `recording` is a `BaseRecording` object, which extracts information about
# channel ids,  channel locations (if present), the sampling frequency of the recording, and the extracellular
# traces. `sorting_true` is a `BaseSorting` object, which contains information
# about spike-sorting related information,  including unit ids, spike trains, etc. Since the data are simulated,
# `sorting_true` has ground-truth information of the spiking activity of each unit.
#
# Let's use the `spikeinterface.widgets` module to visualize the traces and the raster plots.

w_ts = sw.plot_traces(recording, time_range=(0, 5))
w_rs = sw.plot_rasters(sorting_true, time_range=(0, 5))

# This is how you retrieve info from a `BaseRecording`...

# +
channel_ids = recording.get_channel_ids()
fs = recording.get_sampling_frequency()
num_chan = recording.get_num_channels()
num_seg = recording.get_num_segments()

print("Channel ids:", channel_ids)
print("Sampling frequency:", fs)
print("Number of channels:", num_chan)
print("Number of segments:", num_seg)
# -

# ...and from a `BaseSorting`

# +
num_seg = recording.get_num_segments()
unit_ids = sorting_true.get_unit_ids()
spike_train = sorting_true.get_unit_spike_train(unit_id=unit_ids[0])

print("Number of segments:", num_seg)
print("Unit ids:", unit_ids)
print("Spike train of first unit:", spike_train)
# -

# SpikeInterface internally uses the [ProbeInterface](https://probeinterface.readthedocs.io/en/main/) package to handle `probeinterface.Probe` and
# `probeinterface.ProbeGroup`. So any probe in the probeinterface collection can be downloaded and set to a
# `Recording` object. In this case, the MEArec dataset already handles a `Probe` and we don't need to set it *manually*.

# +
probe = recording.get_probe()
print(probe)

from probeinterface.plotting import plot_probe

_ = plot_probe(probe)
# -

# If your recording does not have a `Probe`, you can set it using `set_probe`.
# Note: `set_probe` creates a copy of the recording with the new probe,
# rather than modifying the existing recording in place.
# There is more information [here](https://spikeinterface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules_gallery/core/plot_3_handle_probe_info.html).

# Using the `spikeinterface.preprocessing` module, you can perform preprocessing on the recordings.
# Each pre-processing function also returns a `BaseRecording`,
# which makes it easy to build pipelines. Here, we filter the recording and apply common median reference (CMR).
# All these preprocessing steps are "lazy". The computation is done on demand when we call
# `recording.get_traces(...)` or when we save the object to disk.

# +
recording_cmr = recording
recording_f = si.bandpass_filter(recording, freq_min=300, freq_max=6000)
print(recording_f)
recording_cmr = si.common_reference(recording_f, reference="global", operator="median")
print(recording_cmr)

# this computes and saves the recording after applying the preprocessing chain
recording_preprocessed = recording_cmr.save(format="binary")
print(recording_preprocessed)
# -

# To reload a preprocessed recording that was saved to disk, you can use `load_extractor()` function from the `core` module.
#
# Now you are ready to spike sort using the `spikeinterface.sorters` module!
# Let's first check which sorters are implemented and which are installed

print("Available sorters", ss.available_sorters())
print("Installed sorters", ss.installed_sorters())

# The `ss.installed_sorters()` will list the sorters installed on the machine.
# We can see we have HerdingSpikes and Tridesclous installed.
# Spike sorters come with a set of parameters that users can change.
# The available parameters are dictionaries and can be accessed with:

print("Tridesclous params:")
pprint(ss.get_default_sorter_params("tridesclous"))
print("SpykingCircus2 params:")
pprint(ss.get_default_sorter_params("spykingcircus2"))

# Let's run `tridesclous` and change one of the parameters, say, the `detect_threshold`:

sorting_TDC = ss.run_sorter(sorter_name="tridesclous", recording=recording_preprocessed, detect_threshold=4)
print(sorting_TDC)

# Alternatively we can pass a full dictionary containing the parameters:

# +
other_params = ss.get_default_sorter_params("tridesclous")
other_params["detect_threshold"] = 6

# parameters set by params dictionary
sorting_TDC_2 = ss.run_sorter(
    sorter_name="tridesclous", recording=recording_preprocessed, output_folder="tdc_output2", **other_params
)
print(sorting_TDC_2)
# -

# Let's run `spykingcircus2` as well, with default parameters:

sorting_SC2 = ss.run_sorter(sorter_name="spykingcircus2", recording=recording_preprocessed)
print(sorting_SC2)

# The `sorting_TDC` and `sorting_SC2` are `BaseSorting` objects. We can print the units found using:

print("Units found by tridesclous:", sorting_TDC.get_unit_ids())
print("Units found by spyking-circus2:", sorting_SC2.get_unit_ids())

# If a sorter is not installed locally, we can also avoid installing it and run it anyways, using a container (Docker or Singularity).
# To do this, you will need to install Docker. More information [here](https://spikeinterface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/sorters.html?highlight=docker#running-sorters-in-docker-singularity-containers).
# Let's run `Kilosort2` using Docker:

sorting_KS2 = ss.run_sorter(sorter_name="kilosort2", recording=recording_preprocessed, docker_image=True, verbose=True)
print(sorting_KS2)

# For postprocessing SpikeInterface pairs recording and sorting objects into a `SortingAnalyzer` object.
# The `SortingAnalyzer` can be loaded in memory or saved in a folder. Here, we save it in binary format.

analyzer_TDC = si.create_sorting_analyzer(sorting=sorting_TDC, recording=recording_preprocessed, format='binary_folder', folder='analyzer_TDC_binary')

# This folder is where all the postprocessing data will be saved such as waveforms and templates. Let's calculate
# some waveforms. When doing this, the function samples some spikes (by default `max_spikes_per_unit=500`)
# for each unit, extracts their waveforms, and stores them to disk in `./analyzer_TDC_binary/extensions/waveforms`.
# These waveforms are helpful to compute the average waveform, or "template", for each unit and then to compute, for example, quality metrics.
# Computations with the `SortingAnalyzer` object are done using the `compute` method:

# +
analyzer_TDC.compute("random_spikes")
analyzer_TDC.compute("waveforms")
# -

# The results of these calculations are saved as `extensions`. Some simple data, such as the `unit_ids` can be accessed directly
# from the `SortingAnalyzer` object. Extension data is accessed by first getting the extension then getting the data

# +
unit_id0 = analyzer_TDC.unit_ids[0]
waveforms = analyzer_TDC.get_extension("waveforms").get_data()[unit_id0]
print(waveforms.shape)
# -

# There are many more properties we can calculate

# +
analyzer_TDC.compute("noise_levels")
analyzer_TDC.compute("templates")
analyzer_TDC.compute("spike_amplitudes")
# -

# Many of the extensions have parameters you can tune

# +
analyzer_TDC.compute("unit_locations", method="center_of_mass")
analyzer_TDC.compute("spike_locations", ms_before=0.5)
analyzer_TDC.compute("correlograms", bin_ms=0.1)
analyzer_TDC.compute("template_similarity", method="cosine_similarity")
# -

# Find out more about the available parameters and extensions [here](https://spikeinterface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/postprocessing.html#available-postprocessing-extensions).

# The calculations are saved in the `extensions` subfolder of the `SortingAnalyzer` folder.
# Similar to the waveforms we can access them using `get_extension` and `get_data`. For example,
# here we can make a historgram of spike amplitudes

# +
amplitudes = analyzer_TDC.get_extension("spike_amplitudes").get_data()
plt.hist(amplitudes, bins=50)
plt.show()
# -

# You can check which extensions have been saved (in your local folder) and which have been loaded (in your enviroment)...

# +
print(analyzer_TDC.get_saved_extension_names())
print(analyzer_TDC.get_loaded_extension_names())
# -

# ...or delete an extension...

# +
analyzer_TDC.delete_extension("spike_amplitudes")
# -

# This deletes the extension's data in the `SortingAnalyzer` folder.
#
# Importantly, `SortingAnalyzers` (and all extensions) can be reloaded at later times from their folders:
# (Here, spike_amplitudes is not loaded since we just deleted it)

# +
sorting_analyzer_path = './analyzer_TDC_binary'
analyzer_loaded = si.load_sorting_analyzer(sorting_analyzer_path)
print(analyzer_loaded.get_loaded_extension_names())
# -

# And any deleted extensions are easily recomputed

# +
analyzer_TDC.compute("spike_amplitudes")
# -

# Once we have computed all of the postprocessing information, we can compute quality
# metrics (some quality metrics require certain extensions - e.g., drift metrics require `spike_locations`):

qm_params = sqm.get_default_qm_params()
pprint(qm_params)

# Since the recording is very short, let's change some parameters to accommodate the duration:

qm_params["presence_ratio"]["bin_duration_s"] = 1
qm_params["amplitude_cutoff"]["num_histogram_bins"] = 5
qm_params["drift"]["interval_s"] = 2
qm_params["drift"]["min_spikes_per_interval"] = 2

# Quality metrics are extensions, so computations and data extraction work in the same way as earlier

analyzer_TDC.compute("quality_metrics", qm_params)
analyzer_TDC.get_extension("quality_metrics").get_data()

# And since the quality metrics are extensions, they are saved `SortingAnalyzer` folder.

# Now, we can use some of the powerful tools for spike sorting visualization.

# We can export a sorting summary and quality metrics plot using the `sortingview` backend. This will generate shareable links for web-based visualization.
# For this to work you need to install `sortingview` and construct a `kachery-cloud`: [https://github.com/magland/sortingview](more details).

w1 = sw.plot_quality_metrics(analyzer_TDC, display=False, backend="sortingview")

w2 = sw.plot_sorting_summary(analyzer_TDC, display=False, curation=True, backend="sortingview")

# The sorting summary plot can also be used for manual labeling and curation. In the example above, we manually merged two units (0, 4) and added accept labels (2, 6, 7). After applying our curation, we can click on the "Save as snapshot (sha://)" and copy the URI:

# +
uri = "sha1://68cb54a9aaed2303fb82dedbc302c853e818f1b6"

sorting_curated_sv = scur.apply_sortingview_curation(sorting_TDC, uri_or_json=uri)
print(sorting_curated_sv)
print(sorting_curated_sv.get_property("accept"))
# -

# Alternatively, we can export the data locally to Phy. [Phy](<https://github.com/cortex-lab/phy>) is a GUI for manual
# curation of the spike sorting output. To export to phy you can run:

sexp.export_to_phy(analyzer_TDC, "phy_folder_for_TDC", verbose=True)

# Then you can run the template-gui with: `phy template-gui phy_folder_for_TDC/params.py`
# and manually curate the results.

# After curating with Phy, the curated sorting can be reloaded to SpikeInterface. In this case, we exclude the units that have been labeled as "noise":

sorting_curated_phy = se.read_phy("phy_folder_for_TDC", exclude_cluster_groups=["noise"])

# Quality metrics can be also used to automatically curate the spike sorting
# output. For example, you can select sorted units with a SNR above a
# certain threshold:

# +
qm_data = analyzer_TDC.get_extension("quality_metrics").get_data()
keep_mask = (qm_data["snr"] > 10) & (qm_data["isi_violations_ratio"] < 0.01)
print("Mask:", keep_mask.values)

sorting_curated_auto = sorting_TDC.select_units(sorting_TDC.unit_ids[keep_mask])
print(sorting_curated_auto)
# -

# The final part of this tutorial deals with comparing spike sorting outputs.
# We can either:
#
# 1. compare the spike sorting results with the ground-truth
# sorting `sorting_true`
#
# 2. compare the output of two sorters (e.g. Tridesclous and SpykingCircus2)
#
# 3. compare the output of multiple sorters (e.g. Tridesclous, SpykingCircus2, and Kilosort2)

comp_gt = sc.compare_sorter_to_ground_truth(gt_sorting=sorting_true, tested_sorting=sorting_TDC)
comp_pair = sc.compare_two_sorters(sorting1=sorting_TDC, sorting2=sorting_SC2)
comp_multi = sc.compare_multiple_sorters(
    sorting_list=[sorting_TDC, sorting_SC2, sorting_KS2], name_list=["tdc", "sc2", "ks2"]
)

# When comparing with a ground-truth sorting (1,), you can get the sorting performance and plot a confusion
# matrix

print(comp_gt.get_performance())
w_conf = sw.plot_confusion_matrix(comp_gt)
w_agr = sw.plot_agreement_matrix(comp_gt)

# When comparing two sorters (2.), we can see the matching of units between sorters.
# Units which are not matched have -1 as their unit id:

comp_pair.hungarian_match_12

# or the reverse:

comp_pair.hungarian_match_21

# When comparing multiple sorters (3.), you can extract a `BaseSorting` object with units in agreement
# between sorters. You can also plot a graph showing how the units are matched between the sorters.

# +
sorting_agreement = comp_multi.get_agreement_sorting(minimum_agreement_count=2)

print("Units in agreement between TDC, SC2, and KS2:", sorting_agreement.get_unit_ids())

w_multi = sw.plot_multicomparison_agreement(comp_multi)
w_multi = sw.plot_multicomparison_agreement_by_sorter(comp_multi)
# -

# We see that 10 unit were found by all sorters (note that this simulated dataset is a very simple example, and usually sorters do not do such a great job)!
#
# However, Kilosort2 found 9 additional units that are not matched to ground-truth!

# **That's all for this "How to get started" tutorial! Enjoy SpikeInterface!**
