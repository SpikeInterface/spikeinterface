Handle Drift Tutorial
---------------------

This tutorial is not mean to be displayed on
a sphinx gallery. The generated index.rst is not
meant to be linked to in any toctree.

Instead, sphinx-gallery is used to
automatically build this page, which
takes a long time (~25 minutes), and it is
linked too manually, directly to the
rst (TODO: fill in filename) that
sphinx-gallery generates.
