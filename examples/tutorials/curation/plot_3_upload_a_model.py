Upload a pipeline to Hugging Face Hub
=====================================

##############################################################################
# In this tutorial we will upload a pipeline, trained in SpikeInterface, to the
# `Hugging Face Hub <https://huggingface.co/>`_ (HFH). To do this, you need a HFH account.
# If you do not want to make an account, you can simply share the model folder with colleagues.
# There are also several ways to interaction with HFH: the way we propose here doesn't use
# many of the tools ``skops`` and hugging face have developed such as the ``Card`` and
# ``hub_utils``. Feel free to check those out `here <https://skops.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples.html>`_.
#
# The plan is to make a folder with the following file structure
#
# .. code-block::
#
#     my_model_folder/
#         my_model_name.skops
#         model_info.json
#         training_data.csv
#         labels.csv
#         metadata.json
#
# SpikeInterface doesn't require you to keep this folder structure, we just advise it as
# best practice. So: let's make these files!
#
# If you've used SpikeInterface to train your model, you have already created such a folder,
# containing ``my_model_name.skops`` and ``model_info.json``.
#
# We'll now export the training data. If we trained the model using the function...
#
# .. code-block::
#
#     my_model = train_model(
#         labels=list_of_labels,
#         analyzers=[sorting_analyzer_1, sorting_analyzer_2],
#         output_folder = "my_model_folder"
#     )
#
# ...then the training data is contained in your metric extensions. If you've calculated both
# ``quality_metrics`` and ``template_metrics`` for two `sorting_analyzer`s, you can extract
# and export the training data as follows
#
# .. code-block::
#
#     import pandas as pd
#
#     training_data_1 = pd.concat([
#         sorting_analyzer_1.get_extension("quality_metrics").get_data(),
#         sorting_analyzer_1.get_extension("template_metrics").get_data()
#     ],axis=1)
#
#     training_data_2 = pd.concat([
#         sorting_analyzer_2.get_extension("quality_metrics").get_data(),
#         sorting_analyzer_2.get_extension("template_metrics").get_data()
#     ],axis=1)
#
#     training_data = pd.concat([
#         training_data_1,
#         training_data_2
#     ])
#
#     training_data.to_csv("my_model_folder/training_data.csv")
#
# If you have used different metrics, or use a `.csv` files you will need to modify this code.
#
# Similarly, we can save the curated labels we used:
#
# .. code-block::
#
#     list_of_labels.to_csv("my_model_folder/labels.csv")
#
# Finally, we suggest adding any information which shows when a model is applicable
# (and when it is *not*). Taking a model trained on mouse data and applying it to a primate is
# likely a bad idea. And a model trained in tetrode data will have limited application on a silcone
# high density probe. Hence we suggest the following dictionary as a minimal amount of information
# needed. Note that we format the metadata so that the information in common with the NWB data
# format is consistent with it,
#
# .. code-block::
#
#     model_metadata = {
#         "subject_species": "Mus musculus",
#         "brain_area": "CA1",
#         "probe":
#             {
#              "manufacturer": "Neuropixels",
#              "name": "Neuropixles 2.0"
#             }
#         }
#
#     import json
#     with open("my_model_folder/metadata.json", "w") as file:
#         json.dump(model_metadata, file)
#
# You could now share this folder with a colleague, or upload it to github. Or if you'd
# like to upload the model to Hugging Face Hub, keep reading. We'll use the
# HFH web interface.
#
# First, go to https://huggingface.co/ and make an account. Once you've logged in, press
# ``+`` then ``New model`` or find ``+ New Model`` in the user menu. You will be asked
# to enter a model name, to choose a license for the model and whether the model should
#  be public or private. After you have made these choices, press ``Create Model``.
#
# You should be on your model's landing page, whose header looks something like
#
# .. image:: ../../images/initial_model_screen.png
#     :width: 550
#     :align: center
#     :alt: The page shown on HuggingFaceHub when a user first initialises a model
#
# Click Files, then ``+ Add file`` then ``Upload file(s)``. You can then add your files to the repository. Upload these by pressing ``Commit changes to main``.
#
# You are returned to the Files page, which should look similar to

# Let's add some information about the model for users to see when they go on your model's
# page. Click on ``Model card`` then ``Edit model card``. Here is a sample model card for

#     ##Â Model description
#
#     A toy model, trained on toy data generated from spikeinterface.
#
#     # Intended use
#
#     Used to try out automated curation in SpikeInterface.
#
#     # How to Get Started with the Model
#
#     This can be used to automatically label a sorting in spikeinterface. Provided you have a `sorting_analyzer`, it is used as follows
#
#     ` ` ` python (NOTE: you should remove the spaces between each backtick. This is just formatting for the notebook you are reading)
#
#         from spikeinterface.curation import auto_label_units
#         labels = auto_label_units(
#             sorting_analyzer = sorting_analyzer,
#             repo_id = "SpikeInterface/toy_tetrode_model",
#             trusted = ['numpy.dtype']
#         )
#     ` ` `
#
#     or you can download the entire repositry to `a_folder_for_a_model`, and use
#
#     ` ` ` python
#         from spikeinterface.curation import auto_label_units
#
#         labels = auto_label_units(
#             sorting_analyzer = sorting_analyzer,
#             model_folder = "SpikeInterface/a_folder_for_a_model",
#             trusted = ['numpy.dtype']
#         )
