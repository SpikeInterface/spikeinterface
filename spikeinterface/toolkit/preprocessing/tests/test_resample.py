Check if the sinusoidal gets resampled nicely enough

 -[x] Check that the signals and resampled are in fact similar in frequency domains.
    We are not destroying or adding weird components, in frequency and amplitude,
    Haven't tested on phase, but I think there's a WHOLE lot of debate there.
- [x] Check that RMS of signals don't change when saving with different chunk_sizes
