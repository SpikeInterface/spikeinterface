    """
    General load function to load a SpikeInterface object.

    The function can load:
        - a `Recording` or `Sorting` object from:
            * dictionary
            * json file
            * pkl file
            * binary folder (after `extractor.save(..., format='binary_folder')`)
            * zarr folder (after `extractor.save(..., format='zarr')`)
            * remote zarr folder
        - (TODO) a `SortingAnalyzer` object from :
            * binary folder
            * zarr folder
            * remote zarr folder
            * WaveformExtractor folder

    Parameters
    ----------
    file_or_folder_or_dict : dictionary or folder or file (json, pickle)
        The file path, folder path, or dictionary to load the extractor from
    base_folder : str | Path | bool (optional)
        The base folder to make relative paths absolute.
        If True and file_or_folder_or_dict is a file, the parent folder of the file is used.

    Returns
    -------
    extractor: Recording or Sorting
        The loaded extractor object
