class ResampleRecording(BasePreprocessor):
    """
    Resample the recording extractor traces.

    If the original sampling rate is multiple of the resample_rate, it will use
    the signal.decimate method from scipy. In other cases, it uses signal.resample. In the
    later case, the resulting signal can have issues on the edges, mainly on the
    rightmost.

    Parameters
    ----------
    recording : Recording
        The recording extractor to be re-referenced
    resample_rate : int
        The resampling frequency
    margin : float (default 100)
        Margin in ms for computations, will be used to decrease edge effects.
    dtype : dtype or None
        The dtype of the returned traces. If None, the dtype of the parent recording is used.
    skip_checks : bool
        If True, checks on sampling frequencies and cutoff filter frequencies are skipped, by default False

    Returns
    -------
    resample_recording: ResampleRecording
        The resampled recording extractor object.
